A composite number is a positive number greater than 1 that is not prime (which has [factors](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factor.html) other than 1 and itself). Every composite number has a factor less than or equal to its square root (proof [here](http://mathandmultimedia.com/2012/06/02/determining-primes-through-square-root/)). For example, in the image of the factors of 15 below, notice that the factors in red are just the reverses of the green factors. In other words, by the commutative property of multiplication 3 x 5 = 5 x 3. You just need to include the green pairs to be sure that you have all the factors."
